        "Classification of Trivalent 2-Stratifolds with Finite or Abelian Group",
        "A 2-stratifold is locally modeled on a 2-dimensional space where n-sheets meet. Unlike 2-manifolds, 2-stratifolds are not determined by their fundamental group and a complete list of 2-stratifold groups is unknown. To further understand these groups, we determine which finite groups and which abelian groups are the fundamental group of a 2-stratifold. A powerful tool for studying 2-stratifolds is the associated labelled bicolored graph. This graph essentially determines the homeomophism type. A classification of all labelled graphs that represent 1-connected trivalent 2-stratifold had been previously obtained by  Gomez-Larranaga, Gonzalez-Acuna, and Heil. We extend this classification to labelled graphs that represent trivalent 2-stratifold with finite fundamental group or abelian fundamental group."

        "Rigidity of Intermingled Point and Sphere Configurations",
        "The rigidity of collections of points and the rigidity of collections of circles in the extended complex plane is proven by Beardon and Minda using a maximal amount of conformal invariant information. Crane and Short generalize this work to collections of points and collections of spheres in higher dimensions. Both use a notion of the cross-ratio for 4-tuples of points, while for circles and spheres, the inversive distance between pairs is used. When a collection involves intermingled points and spheres, these conformal invariants can no longer be used. Working in Lorentz space, as Crane and Short do, we develop a notion of an invariant known as the Lorentz ratio, used as a conformal invariant between a point and two spheres. The Lorentz setting allows for an understanding of the correspondences between several geometries, and here, the rigidity of intermingled points and spheres of R&#770;<sup>n</sup> can be seen as part of the more general statement of the rigidity of intermingled points, ideal points, and hyperplanes of hyperbolic (n+1)-space. This rigidity statement is accomplished via the new conformal invariant."

      "Long-Term Secure Deniable Group Key Establishment",
      "In this paper we present a long-term secure deniable group key establishment protocol. Long-term security provides resistance against an adversary, even if some underlying hardness assumptions become invalid later, after completion of the protocol. Deniability feature of a group key establishment protocol allows each participant to join a protocol session and authenticate a message for the other group members, but the receiver(s) cannot convince a third party that such involvement of the group members in the process ever took place. </p><p> The protocol presented here is a long-term secure deniable group key establishment protocol in the random oracle model which remains secure if either a Computational Bilinear Diffie Hellman problem is hard or a server, who shares a symmetric key with each user, is uncorrupted. The technical tools used for the protocol are ring signature, multiparty key encapsulation, and message authentication code."

         "Let (X, &Ascr;) stand for a nonempty set X equipped with a &sigma;-algebra &Ascr; over X. The set of all real-valued &Ascr;-measurable functions on X forms a commutative lattice ordered ring with unity if the relevant operations are defined point wise. My talk will focus on the so-called m-topology on this ring  &Mscr;(X, &Ascr;) and its measure-theoretic generalization. Important topological properties including first countability and connectedness will be discussed."
