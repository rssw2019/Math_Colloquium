        "Classification of Trivalent 2-Stratifolds with Finite or Abelian Group",
        "A 2-stratifold is locally modeled on a 2-dimensional space where n-sheets meet. Unlike 2-manifolds, 2-stratifolds are not determined by their fundamental group and a complete list of 2-stratifold groups is unknown. To further understand these groups, we determine which finite groups and which abelian groups are the fundamental group of a 2-stratifold. A powerful tool for studying 2-stratifolds is the associated labelled bicolored graph. This graph essentially determines the homeomophism type. A classification of all labelled graphs that represent 1-connected trivalent 2-stratifold had been previously obtained by  Gomez-Larranaga, Gonzalez-Acuna, and Heil. We extend this classification to labelled graphs that represent trivalent 2-stratifold with finite fundamental group or abelian fundamental group."
