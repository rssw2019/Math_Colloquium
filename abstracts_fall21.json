        "Modeling the spread of a viral disease can be very complicated, but there are simplified models that can be used to introduce the process to undergraduate students. The SIR and SIRS models use systems of differential equations to model viral disease transmission. An analysis of these models illuminates factors which determine whether a disease can be eliminated or controlled. These models also help explain the role vaccinations play in eradicating disease, even if the entire population is not vaccinated. "
